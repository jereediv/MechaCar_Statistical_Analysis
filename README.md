## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- When evaluating vehicles' MPG, it is evident that engine size, weight and horsepower provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not zero. Because of the correlation between variables and performance, we see a trend with the sloped line.
- The linear model effectively predicts MPG performance effectively. Because we have significant variables/coefficients we are able to predict MPG with some degree of accuracy.
