## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- When evaluating vehicles' MPG, it is evident that vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not zero. Because of the correlation between variables and performance, we see the trend as a sloped line.
- The linear model effectively predicts MPG performance effectively. Because we have significant variables/coefficients we are able to predict MPG with some degree of accuracy.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The total summary table shows an acceptable level of variance overall.

However, the lot summary table shows lot 3 to be unacceptable. Lot 1 and 2 (particularly lot 1) have a low enough variance to bring the total summary within the acceptable range.
